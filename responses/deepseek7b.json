        "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how old Daniel was when he was hired. Let me start by looking at the information given. \n\nDaniel's birthday is March 12, 1990. That means on March 12, every year since then, his age increases by one year. Now, the current company where he works didn't provide a specific date for when he was hired, but I can infer that if today's date isn't specified, we might assume it's around now or maybe using a standard approach.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the information provided, there's no mention of the current year. The dates given are March 12, 1990; work history at ABC Tech Solutions and XYZ Software Corp; and his skills in Python, Java, C++, Cloud Computing, and Machine Learning. But since the query is about his age at the time of hiring, I think there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nThe user mentioned that Daniel was hired before joining the current company, but they didn't provide the date he was hired or the current year. Without knowing today's date or the hiring date, it's impossible to calculate his exact age. For example, if today is 2023 and he was hired in 2018, then as of March 12, 2023, he would be 33 years old. But without that information, I can't give a specific number.\n\nSo, the answer should probably state that there's insufficient information to determine Daniel's age at hiring because the necessary dates aren't provided.\n</think>\n\nThe answer is: Insufficient information to determine Daniel's age at hiring as the necessary date (hiring date) or current year isn't provided.",
